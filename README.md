# IRIS-Dataset-Visualization
Visualizing the IRIS dataset using Seaborn and Matplotlib, showcasing various visualization techniques to explore and understand the data.

Overview:
    This repository contains a collection of visualizations created using Seaborn and Matplotlib to explore the IRIS dataset. The IRIS dataset is a classic multiclass classification problem, consisting of 50 samples from each of three species of iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor).

Visualizations:
- Scatter plots to visualize the relationship between features
- Histograms to visualize the distribution of features
- Box plots to visualize the distribution of features by class
- Violin plots to visualize the distribution of features by class
- Pair plots to visualize the relationship between all features
- Heatmap to visualize the correlation between features

Libraries:
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- NumPy

Data:

- IRIS dataset
- IRIS png(IMAGE)
